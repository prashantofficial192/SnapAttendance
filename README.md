<h3>Face Recognition </h3>

<ul>
  <li>Face Recognition Model</li>
  <p>Face recognition models use AI to identify individuals by analyzing facial features. They extract key facial attributes, represent them mathematically, and compare them with stored templates. Traditional methods use handcrafted features with machine learning, while deep learning models like CNNs automatically learn features from data. Challenges include handling variations in appearance, addressing privacy concerns, and ensuring fairness. Overall, face recognition models offer efficient identification and verification for various applications.
